    <h2>Realstar Hospitality</h2>
    <p>Realstar Hospitality is a unique player in Canada&rsquo;s hotel industry. Headquartered in Toronto, Realstar Hospitality is a full-service hotel franchise company, leveraging the strength of its brands by providing an extensive range of business-building, best-in-class support services to its more than 140 franchised hotels across the country. From training, quality assurance and procurement expertise to global sales, marketing and operations excellence, franchisees benefit from full access to a team of hospitality professionals. The Company&rsquo;s focus is fully aligned with franchise owners in building top line revenues, maximizing operation efficiencies and minimizing operating expenses.</p>

    <h3 id='section1'>Days Inn</h3>
    <p>Days Inns - Canada is one of Canada&rsquo;s leading hotel brands. Under the stewardship of Realstar Hospitality, this upscale economy brand has grown from a handful of locations in southern Ontario in 1992 (the year Realstar Hospitality acquired the Canadian master franchise rights) to more than 110 independently owned and operated properties from coast to coast to coast.</p>
    <p>Key to this impressive growth was the creation of two impressive, designed-in-Canada prototypes, the first introduced in the mid-1990’s, the second in mid-2000’s. Each prototype was a thoughtful exercise in guest satisfaction and owner costs, and focussed on contemporary design concepts with longevity in mind.</p>
    <p>Days Inn is one of 15 highly recognizable brands part of Wyndham Hotel Group&rsquo;s global portfolio. As the world&rsquo;s largest hotel company based on number of hotels, Wyndham Hotel Group unites its iconic brands with the richest and simplest rewards guest loyalty program in the business &mdash; Wyndham Rewards<sup>&reg</sup>. The program offers members a simple-to-use, generous points earning structure along with a flat, free night redemption rate. Wyndham Rewards provides more than 48 million members the opportunity to earn and redeem points at 25,000 hotels, condos and homes globally.</p>

    <h3 id='section2'>Motel 6</h3>
    <p>Motel 6 has built a strong reputation in the marketplace for providing quality and comfortable lodging, at an affordable rate. Aside from its low prices, Motel 6 may be best known for its celebrated advertising campaigns and tagline &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll Leave the Light on for you<sup>&reg;</sup>&rdquo; featuring Tom Bodett.</p>
    <p>In 2003, Realstar Hospitality acquired the Canadian master franchise rights for Motel 6 and Studio 6 brands. Growth in Canada has been compelling, with both new build and conversion opportunities available. Reinventing economy lodging, the award-winning Motel 6 prototype design features modern styling and functionality. Newly-designed rooms with comfortable and contemporary furnishings has positioned Motel 6 as a desirable brand.</p>
    <p>Realstar Hospitality&rsquo;s franchise portfolio includes a combined total of almost 30 Motel 6 and Studio 6 properties Canada-wide. Roughly 75% of the locations were purpose-built new construction. In October 2012, a fund managed by the Blackstone Group acquired both brands. The Blackstone Group then established G6 Hospitality LLC as the management company for Motel 6 and Studio 6.</p>

    <h3 id='section3'>Studio 6</h3>
    <p>Motel 6 introduced the Studio 6 concept in 1998 as an extended-stay option for travellers. Studio 6 properties allow for guests to stay in the comforts of home while enjoying an inclusive rate, competitive to the economy extended-stay tier. As one of the segment&rsquo;s up and coming brands, Studio 6 is uniquely positioned with its &ldquo;More in your room, Less on your bill&trade;&rdquo; strategy. The brand&rsquo;s strong affiliation with Motel 6, combined with a long-standing operating platform, is focused on delivering results.</p>
    <p>The Studio 6 prototype features a contemporary, simple and functional design that is a major step forward for extended-stay lodging. The studios, which are approximately 260-320 square feet, feature an open floor plan to maximize space usage. All locations offer an updated modern room layout featuring a comfortable seating area, sleeping area and fully equipped kitchen with refrigerator, microwave and cooktop stove.</p>
    <p>Studio 6 has quickly developed a reputation for excellence, ease and value with travellers who need accommodations for more than a few nights. Although lesser known among Canadians, the Studio 6 brand looks very similar to a Motel 6 (think wood effect flooring, flat panel TVs, granite bathroom countertops, and a chic, modern design and colour scheme).</p>
    <p>Having already grown the Motel 6 and Studio 6 brands significantly over the past few years, Realstar Hospitality has set upon a path to further increase brand presence across Canada.</p>
